# devHeli0-Vercel

## Overview

devHeli0-Vercel is not just a full-stack web application; it's my personal playground and a continuous opportunity to refine and apply various development concepts. Crafted by [devHeli0](https://github.com/devHeli0), this project covers both the front-end and back-end components. It is more than just a web application; it's my digital space to showcase my skills, explore new technologies, and maintain a consistent training regimen.
### Front-end: `devheli0-front-dev`

The front-end of the project is built using React and Vite for a fast and efficient development environment. It includes features such as internationalization (i18n) support, routing with React Router, and integration with FontAwesome icons. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
